# TE3001B: Robotics Foundation

  ## Introduction
   * This course, developed by Manchester Robotics ltd. (MCR2), introduces the basic concepts and general knowledge of the ROS environment to the user.
   * The course is divided into five session, carefully designed for the user to learn about the different aspects of ROS  from topics and messages to control and simulation using ROS.
   * This course will be based on challenges to make the student aware of ROS basics and ROS communication with hardware.
   * This branch contains all the presentations, activities and files required for the “TE3001B: Fundamentación de Robótica” course of the Tec de Monterrey.
   * This repository is organised by sessions, each subfolder contains all the neccesary files for each one of the activities of this course.
   
## General Information
* Duration 5 Weeks
* Classes: Monday and Thursday  (1 – 2 PM) / 5 Weeks
* Starts: 13 February.
* Ends: 17 March
* ZOOM Link Classes: https://itesm.zoom.us/j/4779422764

## General Requirements
General requirements. Please be aware that a set of requirements especific for each session will be shown in each session subsection (Some items may be repeated).
* Computer with access to Zoom (online classes).
* Computer with Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic or MCR2 virtual machine (installation instructions in the presentation MCR2_VM_ROS).
* Knowledge of Windows. 
* Basic knowledge of Ubuntu (recommended).
* Basic understanding of robotics (recommended).
* Access to Hackerboard and a MCR2 DC motor. 
  * In case you have no access to the Hackeborad, the hardware can be replaced for an Arduino Mega, a L298n Motor Driver and a DC motor brushed with encoder (More information MCR2_General_Information_Prerequisites).
